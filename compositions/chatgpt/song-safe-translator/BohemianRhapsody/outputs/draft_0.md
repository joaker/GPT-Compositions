## [Intro]
Is this a daydream? Or just make-believe?
Caught in a fun slide, no pause in our play spree
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a young kid, no worries for me
Because I'm playful, happy go, a bit up, a bit down
Wherever the wind blows, it's all fun to me, to me

## [Verse 1]
Mama, I just drew a man
With my crayons in my hand, now he's here on my page
Mama, my drawing has just begun
But now I've got to go and clean up my mess
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make a mess
If my room isn't clean by tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if it's all just fine

## [Verse 2]
Oh dear, it's getting late
Chills from the cool night, feeling sleepy all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Time to put my toys away and say goodnight
Mama, ooh (Wherever the wind blows)
I donâ€™t wanna sleep
Sometimes I wish bedtime never came at all

## [Verse 3]
I see a little shadow of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, can we do the dance?
Lights up the stage like a bright, starry fantasy
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo dance with me, magnificent
I'm just a young kid, everyone loves me
He's just a young kid having a fun time
Let's play a game with this fantasy
Easy go, easy play, shall we let him go?
Bismillah, yes, we will let you go
(Let him play) Bismillah, yes, we will let you play
(Let him play) Bismillah, yes, we will let you play
(Let me go) We will let you go
(Let me go) We will let you go
(Always, always, always, always let me go) Yay
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me play
The playground is a magical place for me, for me, for me

## [Bridge]
So you think you can chase me and tag me in the game?
So you think we can play hide and seek today?
Oh, buddy, you can't catch me, buddy
I just gotta run out, just gotta dash right out of here

## [Outro]
(Oh)
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters but fun
Wherever the wind blows
