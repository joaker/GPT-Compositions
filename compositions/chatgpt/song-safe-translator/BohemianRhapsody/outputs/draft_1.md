## [Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I’m just a little kid, I mean no worry
Because I’m free as the breeze, high and low with ease
Any way the wind blows doesn’t really matter to me, to me

## [Verse 1]
Mama, just drew a man
With my crayon, here on my hand, now he’s on this paper
Mama, my game has just begun
But now I’ve gone and washed it all away
Mama, ooh, didn’t mean to make you frown
If I’m not neat again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

## [Verse 2]
Too late, my bedtime's come
Sends shivers down my spine, sleep is ticking all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I’ve got to go
Got to leave you all behind and face the bed
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don’t wanna sleep
I sometimes wish I’d never had to at all

## [Verse 3]
I see a little shadow of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo let's go see
But I’m just a little kid, nobody scolds me
He's just a little kid from a kind family
Spare him from this strict old fantasy
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!)

## [Bridge]
So you think you can stop me and mess with my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to dry?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

## [Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
